		In case you haven’t heard the news, we are planning our first-ever Wistia conference, and we are super excited! We want to give people more comprehensive guidance on the entire video marketing “lifecycle,” but also, we’re excited about the chance to bring people together, creating a stronger in-person community. Not only will this give us a chance to hang out with and get to know people who also care about video, but it also gives them a chance to meet up and learn from one another.

		In some ways, this has been a long time coming. People ask us for guidance a lot, and there’s a real dearth of information out there for marketers who want to use video. There isn’t really a major event out there for the community of people who care about video marketing. We’ve tested the waters with various past events, like parties, workshops, and talks, so it finally feels like it’s within our wheelhouse to do something like this. These were the “pros” in our decision-making process.

		But we bumped into one question we weren’t sure how to answer along the way: could we put on a conference and still have it feel as warm, convivial, and action-oriented as possible? Most of us have been to a “typical” conference, where the norm is talking heads in front of PowerPoint screens. These presentations are interspersed with impersonal “networking” sessions that leave you with a million business cards but very few conversations and connections that feel genuine. Though these events offer snippets of helpful information, they can also feel cold, corporate, and impersonal.
